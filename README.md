# Encap64

## Disclaimer: 
This code is a basic example for educational purposes only. It does not provide secure encryption. For production-grade applications, consider using strong encryption algorithms and secure key management practices.

## Description:
This Python script creates a simple graphical user interface (GUI) application that allows users to encrypt and decrypt text. The current implementation uses base64 encoding, which is not secure.

## Usage:

1. Run the Python script.
2. Enter the text you want to encrypt or decrypt.
3. Enter the password (currently hardcoded as "1234").
4. Click the "Encrypt" or "Decrypt" button.

## Limitations:

1. Uses insecure base64 encoding.
2. Hardcoded password for decryption.
3. Basic GUI with limited functionality.

## Improvements:

1. Implement strong encryption algorithms like AES.
2. Use secure key management practices.
3. Enhance the GUI with features like file saving, loading, and copy/paste.
4. Improve error handling and user feedback.

## Dependencies:

1. tkinter
2. messagebox
3. base64

## How to Run:

1. Save the code as a Python file (encap64.py).
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the script.
4. Run the script using python encap64.py.
