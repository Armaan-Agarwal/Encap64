# Encap64

# Disclaimer: 
This code is a basic example for educational purposes only. It does not provide secure encryption. For production-grade applications, consider using strong encryption algorithms and secure key management practices.

# Description:
This Python script creates a simple graphical user interface (GUI) application that allows users to encrypt and decrypt text. The current implementation uses base64 encoding, which is not secure.

# Usage:

Run the Python script.
Enter the text you want to encrypt or decrypt.
Enter the password (currently hardcoded as "1234").
Click the "Encrypt" or "Decrypt" button.

# Limitations:

Uses insecure base64 encoding.
Hardcoded password for decryption.
Basic GUI with limited functionality.

# Improvements:

Implement strong encryption algorithms like AES.
Use secure key management practices.
Enhance the GUI with features like file saving, loading, and copy/paste.
Improve error handling and user feedback.

# Dependencies:

tkinter
messagebox
base64

# How to Run:

Save the code as a Python file (encap64.py).
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory containing the script.
Run the script using python encap64.py.
